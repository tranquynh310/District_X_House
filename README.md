# District_X_House
## INTRODUCTION

This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about houses in given District X. The dataset is comprised of 13 attributes, each providing valuable insights into the characteristics of houses within the district. The main objective of this analysis is to create a simple predictive model for the "Median House Value," which serves as the output attribute.

The primary task involves exploring the dataset, understanding the relationships between different attributes, and developing a simple predictive model for the "Median House Value." This notebook will walk through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
